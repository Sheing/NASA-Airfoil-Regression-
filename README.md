 NASA data set, obtained from a series of aerodynamic and acoustic tests of two and three-dimensional airfoil sections conducted in an anechoic wind tunnel. The data set comprises different size NACA 0012 airfoils at various wind tunnel speeds and angles of attack. The span of the airfoil and the observer position were the same in all of the experiments###\n",
