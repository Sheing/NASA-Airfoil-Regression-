 NASA data set, obtained from a series of aerodynamic and acoustic tests of two and three-dimensional airfoil sections conducted in an anechoic wind tunnel. The data set comprises different size NACA 0012 airfoils at various wind tunnel speeds and angles of attack. The span of the airfoil and the observer position were the same in all of the experiment

#DataSet Explanation
First off, I have to admit I picked this datasets because it has something to do with NASA. Secondly, it is an easy data to analyze since it only has 6 attributes. The purpose of analysing this data is to predict the value of scaled sound pressure level given 5 different attributes mentioned below.
Target Column: 1.Frequency, in Hertzs. 2.Angle of attack, in degrees. 3.Chord length, in meters. 4.Free-stream velocity, in meters per second. 5.Suction side displacement thickness, in meters.
Predict Column: 6.Scaled sound pressure level, in decibels.
This data doesn't contain missing values. The only thing I did prior experiment is to convert .DAT to csv file.
